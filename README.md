# Stock-Market-Analysis

This is a streamlit App project where I analyze the stock market. The project is written in Python with some packages such as numpy, pandas, plotly, seaborn, yfinance, BeautifulSoup. 

The project includes 5 sections:
1. Display some trading properties about one specific stock such as price, volume, moving average, and daily returns.
2. Display the correlations of daily returns between different stocks via pair plot and heat map.
3. Investigate Expected Return vs Risk of some stocks
4. Investigate Value at Risk of a stock
5. Predict Stock price using Monte Carlo Simulation

To run the project, please download the file and import dependent packages. Open terminal from an IDE and run this command:
"streamlit run stock_analysis.py"
